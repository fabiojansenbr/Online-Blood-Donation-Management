# Online-Blood-Donation-Management
My first Node.js web application built using Express framework and MongoDB as database.

This application has following actions:
1. Allows users to register and login.
2. An authenticated user is able to request for a type of blood in emergency.
3. A registered user can become a donor of blood with address details.
4. Requested user will get the details of donors in email and contact in the fly.
5. Intelligence of application is same donor details are not provided frequently and data privacy is maintained.
